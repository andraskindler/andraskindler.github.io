<h2 class="page-title">What Iâ€™m working on now</h2>

<p>Last updated: 7. March, 2025.</p>

<p>My main focus is on <a href="https://brew.dev" target="_blank">Brew</a>, a product development agency. The vision is similar to our previous company, <a href="https://makery.co" target="_blank">Makery</a>: to build a company where we would also be happy to work. Clients with positive impact, vibrant community, and a strong work-life balance, in the age of AI.</p>

<p>Besides Brew, I have the following side quests:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Building and growing <a href="https://followergrow.com" target="_blank">Followergrow</a>, an AI-powered iOS app helping with engagement and writing for X.</li>
    <li>I try to dedicate time to my personal site. I got back into writing after a long time, and plan to publish a post every now and then. I also like to tinker around with the tech behind the site, and I enjoy how basic it is: a combination of Jekyll, CSS, and Markdown.</li>
    <li>I'm working on leveling up my growth skillset, mainly interested in marketing, sales, and personal branding.</li>
</ul>
