An unwritten rule of entrepreneurship (and yes, life in general) is that there is always more things to take care of than there is time available. There are multiple strategies and tools to solve prioritisation, and doing this well plays an important role in success.

Personally, I’ve always been a todo list person most of my life. They worked fine while I was focusing more on the individual contributor path, and when my company was smaller, but as I ventured more into leadership and my company grew in size, it slowly became a source of frustration. 

My todo lists have a tendency of being endless. I keep on adding new items, and even if everything is properly prioritised and categorised, there is just no end in sight, with the (not so) rare occasions of a hard reset. 

At a certain point it occurred to me that *most probably* this is not an issue with the apps I’ve tried, but rather with my personal preferences and mindset. Because for me, the problem was not about how easy it is to add or prioritise a task, but how to squeeze everything important the day, without getting overwhelmed by their sheer amount. This became even more apparent as the scope of my responsibilities grew: my company reaching a certain scale, then becoming a VP at a unicorn after an exit.[^1] It was getting increasingly difficult to allocate time for every topic I wanted to drive. 

I needed to take back the control over my time.

## Adapting the calendar as a todo list
I learned about using the calendar as a daily/weekly todo list from a friend. The idea was simple: instead of having an endless backlog, the tasks are time slots in a calendar, similar to setting up a meeting, but with only me attending. This was a brand new concept to me, and the more I thought about it, the more sense it made. 

There is a direct correlation between a task and the time it takes to complete it, and by looking at todos as time slots when designing my week, this becomes very apparent. Short-term prioritisation also becomes more straightforward: if a new high-prio task comes up, there has to be a tradeoff. There is a clear indication to what can be accomplished in a day, a week. 

The same correlation goes for meetings as well. Scheduling a meeting or accepting an invite take a visible toll.

As tasks are translated into calendar slots, estimating the time it takes to accomplish, or meaningfully progress forward with each is inherently built into the system. This is very important, because when organising my week, I usually underestimate the time for each task.

This system is also helpful when interrupts happen, as I know what to jump back into just by looking at my calendar. And it makes tradeoffs painfully visible, depending on the length of the interruption.

## Customising the system
I gave it a try a few years ago, and while the transition during the first few weeks was difficult, I pushed through, and it stuck. I started with a vanilla approach, and tailored it over time. This is what I’ve learned so far:

- I strive for planning the day on the evening before, or first thing in the morning. It helps to bring closure to the day as well.
- Estimating the time each task takes is key. I usually overestimate how much I can take care of in a day, so I have to be mindful. Generally, when in doubt, I increase the originally planned duration by 30 mins or more.
- Often my estimations are still not good enough, but this system provides a solid answer. If I need more time to finish, I simply look at the todos for the week, and reprioritise.
- Batching similar tasks into thematic blocks works great to keep myself in the flow. For example, I often schedule a half-day block for coding or writing, and I have a marketing day every week.
- I use color coding for different types of tasks: personal, and one for each of my projects. This gives me an overview of what did I spend my time during the week at a glance.
- I do have small and unrelated tasks every day. I batch these together, and have multiple *admin* slots in my calendar throughout the week. These contain micro todo lists, attached to every slot.
- Taking care of recurring topics is simple, as they are simply set up as repeating items in my calendar.
- If a task requires more details, or is made up of subtopics, I add a description the calendar entries, just like a meeting agenda.
- I do still keep a general task list, but now more so for keeping backlogs, not for daily planning. I use it as input when organising my next week.

## After 3 years
In retrospect, it is connecting the two dimensions of tasks (backlog) and time (calendar) is a no-brainer.

Using the calendar as a todo list instead of only meetings is a simple concept, yet it is fundamentally different from a solely backlog-based approach. It does have a learning curve and requires extra administrative overhead, but it works well for me in my current situation. It is clearly not a silver bullet, but it did make my life much more organised.

[^1] I returned to the good old todo list (I'm using Apple Notes by the way) when I went on a sabbatical, before starting to build my next company. The feeling of losing control over my time became apparent again recently, when I got back to work, and became a dad. Luckily, having experienced this radical increase of responsibilities already, I knew what to do: I returned to the very same system detailed in this post. So far, so good!
