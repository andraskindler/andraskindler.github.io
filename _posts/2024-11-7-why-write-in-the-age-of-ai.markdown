AI is becoming highly available, and is taking the writing space by storm. LLMs are widely used to generate content everywhere: copywriting, blog posts, pSEO, social posts, you name it. It is indeed much easier to generate an article with AI in a few seconds, even with an unsophisticated prompt. For free! Why would anyone in their right mind write themself instead, which is a fundamentally difficult and tedious process?

One argument could be that the quality of human output is better, which is certainly true. AI cannot write Pulitzer prize winning novels, beautiful poems, or captivating screenplays. At least not yet. I do know my limits though, and this also does not apply to me.

I rather look at this with a perspective shift: instead of writing with the hope of it being interesting for other people, I do it for the benefit of myself. If the result ends up being useful for other people as well, even better.

## Why do I write?

It leads to clearer thinking. My writing process involves organising what I know and researching the blank spots, to form a cohesive piece of content. It is an excellent way to challenge and validate ideas, to reason, to synthesize information, to prepare for a big decision, to collect pros and cons, to come up with plans.

Writing forces me to be thorough. I go through a structured thought process, consume a lot of relevant content, research, and try to cover the edge cases and tiny details as well. Essentially, my writing process guides me to learn about a subject.

Good writing is short and concise. Having this in mind during content creation improves the ability to summarize thoughts, distill complex topics into key points and essentials, and remove all the fluff.

English is my second language, and I want to put conscious effort into maintaining it. Besides reading and having conversations in English, writing also helps a lot. For example, I run grammar checks, look for synonyms, and try to simplify and rephrase sentences to make them easier to read.

Everyone has a unique writing style. Writing allows me to find mine, maintain it, polish it, and in general, to be able to use it. The more I write, the more natural it becomes.

Writing (especially, often and consistently) is a difficult process, at least for me. I believe that doing difficult things makes me better. I feel great when I finish an essay.

## Is it worth all the effort?

There is a good place for AI in generating and improving text, I'm using it as well for certain cases. But I believe that using AI to write every piece of content is not only about outsourcing writing, but essentially, outsourcing thinking as well. With so many shifting to AI, being a good enough writer will be a competitive advantage.

Write for yourself, think for yourself, improve yourself.
